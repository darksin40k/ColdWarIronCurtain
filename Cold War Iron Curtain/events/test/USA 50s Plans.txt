USA_INDONESIA.5 America Calls for Humanitarian Intervention in Indonesia
"The situation in Indonesia has deteriorated as many patriotic Indonesians in Sumatra continue to oppose the government for its communist leanings. The government of Sukarno continues a heavy handed approach including cutting off essential supplies for those it accuses of rebelling. Under the advice of the CIA, the President has directed the State Department and United Nations mission to launch a diplomatic and public campaign calling for a humanitarian intervention in the conflict to prevent a massive loss of life. The CIA believes such a mission can provide an opportunity for us to expand contacts with the anti-communists and lay the groundwork for future action."
USA_INDONESIA.6 CIA Bomber Shot Down in Indonesia
"The CIA recently dispatched obscured bombers piloted by former Air Force pilots through a front organization called Civil Air Transport to support the Sumatra anti-communist rebels against the Indonesian government. These pilots were covertly launching bombing runs against Indonesian positions from rebel-controlled airfields. Unfortunately, the Indonesians shot down a bomber piloted by Allen Lawrence Pope. His B-26, after a bombing run was intercepted and shot down. Pope and a rebel crewmember managed to bail out but were captured by Indonesian forces. His capture confirms accusations by the government that rebel planes are being flown by American and Nationalist Chinese planes. We are denying involvement and claiming Pope was a mercenary, but the incident is a major embarrassment and we will end the operation."
USA_INDONESIA.7 Lessons from Indonesia (American CIA Failure Indonesia Summary)
"Our operation in Indonesia ended in failure, the anti-communist Sumatra rebels were defeated and Sukarno now appears to be in a much stronger position. The reasons for this failure are many, for one we underestimated the capabilities of the Indonesian military. Our efforts to support propaganda stations and rebel basis were thwarted by government attacks. The Indonesian military itself has many anti-communist officers and our actions risked turning them against us. The rebels and anti-communist factions were actually further divided by our actions to prop up the rebels, providing an opportunity to the communists to more closely align with the government. We also failed to shore up other Western powers and did not commit enough forces to ensure rebel success."
USA_INDONESIA.1 American Condemnation of Human Rights Abuses in Sumatra
"The United States condemned the human rights situation in Sumatra both at the United Nations and White House. The American government accuses the Indonesian government of using extreme violence and starvation against the people of Sumatra. This marks an internationalization of the recent rebellion of anti-communist Indonesian military officers who have seized Sumatra. The rebels are demanding the Indonesian government dissolve itself and ensure the removal of all communist influence from the nation. The Indonesian government so far has maintained control over most of the armed forces and its leader, Sukarno denies any alliance with communists or human rights abuses. Instead he says the rebels are a cabal of disgruntled men demanding power at the expense of Indonesian democracy. The United States action is being viewed with grave concern by other powers who fear American involvement may escalate the crisis."
USA_INDONESIA.8 American Naval Exercises off Indonesia
"The United States Navy has initiated large naval exercises off the coast of Indonesia and near Sumatra, where rebel forces are currently battling government troops. The United States has recently began criticizing the Indonesian government for its heavy-handed tactics in dealing with the rebels and refusing to listen to their demands. The rebels are demanding the Indonesian government, led by Sukarno, relinquish power and purge the communist party from any participation either in government or politics. The government denies excessive communist influence and accuses the rebels, consisting of military officers, of trying to undermine democracy to seize power. The American naval deployment and its criticism will only weaken the position of the Indonesian government and provide a strong show of support for the rebels."
INO_USA_WAR.1 American Intervention in the Sumatran Revolt
"In an address to the nation, the President of the United States announced American military forces were immediately deploying in Indonesia to protect the Sumatra rebels. The President noted the Indonesian government was using extreme tactics to end the revolt, needlessly putting millions of civilian lives at risk. He also stated the Indonesian government was increasingly falling under the thrall of foreign communist influence and the American intervention would not only save lives but save democracy for the people of Indonesia. The Indonesian government responded furiously, claiming the Sumatra rebels were simply a puppet force for the American government and that all Indonesians would unite to defeat the invading Americans."
INO_USA_WAR.5 The Partitioning of Indonesia
"The United States announced plans to partition Indonesia. The American government noted the current Indonesian state was far too diverse and spread out geographically to allow an effective central government. Such a system made it vulnerable to localized revolts and those living outside the main islands were prone to neglect from the center. With partition, all peoples on the islands will have access to a receptive government and no one island can impose its values or beliefs across all others simply because they control key state apparatuses. The decision is facing criticism among urban Indonesians, many of whom argue the partition plan will only provoke more conflict between the islands. Other argue the partition is really just a tool to ensure Indonesia never achieves its potential to become a major global player."
INO_USA_WAR.4 Evaluating Our Options in Indonesia (Whether to Reform the Central Government or Partition)
"With our successful intervention in Indonesia, we have the ability to dictate a resolution to the conflict. One option is to restore the central government and hand over power to the Sumatra rebel leader Colonel Ahmed Hussein. He will establish a strong regime and purge all communists from the country. Analysts believe his stance is popular among military officers. He could coordinate a robust, national anti-communist program. An alternative solution to Colonel Hussein is to partition Indonesia, as many analysts believe Indonesia is too large and geographically divided to be governed as it is currently. The unwieldly state apparatus makes Indonesia especially vulnerable to communist infiltration. Partition would prevent this and block a major avenue for communist infestation in the region."
INO_USA_WAR.6 PRRI (Colonel Hussein) Solidifies Power
"With American backing, Colonel Ahmed Hussein has solidified his control over Indonesia. Colonel Hussein came to prominence as one of the main rebel military officers in Sumatra. He delivered the ultimatum to the Indonesian government for the restoration of government officials and new elections. However, the government refused, resulting in an armed conflict. With American support, the rebels were able to triumph. He is expected to announce a cabinet consisting of the top national, anti-communist political leaders. His current military junta has several prominent and highly respected anti-communist officers. New elections are being promised, along with the banning of communists and other groups viewed as threats to the Indonesian state and democracy. The CIA and American embassy are reportedly playing a major role behind the scenes to protect the Hussein regime from counter-coups being planned by more senior officers."
INO_CIA_EXPOSURE.0 Involvement Hidden (Indonesian Bombing)
"The CIA, using a front company in Thailand has successfully been shifting bombers and pilots to support the Indonesian rebels in Sumatra. Our pilots have successfully been conducting strafing and bombing runs on Indonesian military targets and airfields. The bombers are slowly being transferred over to rebel pilots and it is clear our operations have not been exposed. We have managed to avoid exposure by the Indonesian government, allowing us to support the rebels and publicly remain a neutral party in the conflict. This will give us greater flexibility in pressuring Indonesia to stop its increasingly alignment with local communists."
INO_CIA_EXPOSURE.1 Bombing Program Exposed
"The CIA, using a front company in Thailand, had tried to clandestinely provide bombers and pilots to rebels in Sumatra. However, the Indonesian government has managed to shoot down a bomber and capture a pilot, exposing their origin. This is a major embarrassment for our government and a failure for the CIA. The Indonesians are furious and our reputation in the region will suffer as a result. It will require a lot of effort to re-establish trust with Indonesia. Along with the Indonesian government, the Soviet Union and regional communist parties are gleefully publicizing our embarrassment. The CIA director was given a dressing down by the President."
INO_CIA_EXPOSURE.2 American Bomber Shot Down over Indonesia?
"The Indonesian government has released news that an American bomber, flying for rebel forces in Sumatra, was shot down while attacking a government military airfield. The American Embassy quickly declined any involvement, however, Indonesian newspapers published photos of the downed airplane and an American pilot being held in custody. The downed plane, a World War II American plane, had Republic of China symbols under a recently applied fresh coat of plane. The Indonesian government noted the captured pilot, and origin of the plane indicated direct involvement from the United States. The American government now insists any American planes or pilots involved were mercenaries, not representatives or agents of the United States. Despite its claims, most nations appear to be siding with Indonesia and are calling for the United States to halt any assistance it is giving to rebel forces."
Sumatran_Revolt.50 The Indonesian Civil War (Sumatran Revolt Escalates into Civil War instigated by CIA)
"Indonesian rebels in Sumatra, mostly military units, recently started a revolt demanding the Sukarno government stepdown. The rebels believe communist influence in Jakarta is growing and Sukarno is falling to their influence. Efforts by Sukarno to resolve the issues and prevent an escalation have had some early success. However, the CIA believes with its backing, it can bring more support for the rebels and turn the revolt into a full-scale uprising against Sukarno. This would gravely weaken Sukarno and ensure help ensure the communists do not manipulate their way to power."
