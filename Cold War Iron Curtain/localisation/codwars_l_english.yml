 codwar.1.d:0 "Fishing has always been one of the pillars Iceland's of economy. However, the waters around our island nation have become overfished, threatening our traditional way of life. If we don't reduce our current fish production soon, our fishing industry is sure to collapse in the long term."
 codwar.2.d:0 "To save our fishing industry - an important source of income for us - we can either reduce fishing quotas or exploit new fishing grounds. If we don't expand our territorial waters and opt to reduce fishing quotas, our nation's fishermen will react with anger. Another question is how far any expansion should reach."
 codwar.3.d:0 "Iceland's seas are overfished, so the Icelandic government decided to simply expand their territorial waters and claim new fishing grounds - at the expense of our own fishermen who now need protection from the Navy in the 'new' Icelandic waters. It is unlikely that Iceland, which depends on the fishing industry, will give in here, but can we accept this provocation?"
 codwar.4.d:0 "The so-called 'Cod War' is almost over. Britain will soon officially accede to the expansion of our territorial waters. Although British shipping continues to violate our sovereignty for the time being, the British government has indicated that this adventure is becoming too expensive for them and they will soon withdraw their naval support from the British fishing fleet."
 codwar.5.d:0 "The so-called 'Cod War' is drags on, and the conflict shows no sign of coming to an end in the near future. We are certain that Britain will accept the expansion of our territorial waters eventually, but at this time British ships still stubbornly violate our sovereignty. Until the British ships leave, we will have to bear the expense of protecting our fishing fleet."
