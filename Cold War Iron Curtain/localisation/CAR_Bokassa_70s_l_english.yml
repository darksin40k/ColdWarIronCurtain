 central_africa.600.d:0 "Emperor Bokassa I of the Central African Empire, who had ruled that country autocratically since 1965, was overthrown in a bloodless coup last night, Agence France‐Presse reported from Bangui, the capital, citing French Embassy sources.\n The news agency said David Dacko, a 49‐year‐old former President, had seized power and proclaimed the country a republic. In 1965 the Emperor, then Col. Jean‐Bédel Bokassa, ousted Mr. Dacko and placed him under house arrest. He released him and took him on as a personal adviser three years ago.\n One report said that the 58‐year‐old Emperor had fled the country, probably for Libya."
