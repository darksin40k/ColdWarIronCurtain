 Fulro_1_desc:0 "A new organization has risen from the jungles of Vietnam. From propaganda posters to armed struggles, the United Front for the Liberation  of Oppressed Races have risen up to arms against both South and North Vietnam - clamoring for the rights and autonomy of the Montagnards, they have been determined in their battles. Most say Cambodia and China are the ones responsible for funding and supporting this group. Whether it succeeds in its struggles are still to be seen.\n In 1958, a group of French intellectuals mounted the predecessor to FULRO, whose objective was to defend the Bahnar people, the Jarai, the Rhade and the K'Ho people. Named BAJARAKA, it lived for a short period of time before merging with both the Front for the Liberation of Champa and the Liberation Front of Kampuchea Krom, both groups originated in Cambodia that fought for their respective ethnicities. The Montagnards, The ethnic group that most composed FULRO, are composed of 2.25 million people, with a dozen tribes and various languages spoken."
 North_Vietnam_1_desc:0 "The heart of the founder of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has stopped. Ho Chi Minh lies still and peacefully on his deathbed; heart failure took the founder of Vietnamese Socialism from the nation and has thus left it momentarily leaderless. Born in May of 1890, the elusive Ho Chi Minh was known to use at the very least fifty pseudonyms, with an unknown or at the very least, uncertain place and date of birth, the leader of North Vietnam was loved by many and hated by many others, especially in South Vietnam; a writer, journalist, poet and polyglot - he was an inspirational figure who led the Democratic Republic of Vietnam through turbulent times and was unyielding in his faith that Vietnam is to be united under one banner."
 North_Vietnam_2_desc:0 "\nThe government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has announced that it will begin a series of land reforms in order to benefit the peasantry and the rural workers; while initially adopting a moderate stance and compromising with the landlords in regards to the lands, with a simple reduction in land rent, the North Vietnamese government has started a more hardline and radical reform, being inspired by the Chinese. Deeming landlords as traitorous elements of the cause and forming a special people's tribunal court; most of which are composed by peasants with little to no expertise regarding law and dishing out arbitrary sentences that vary from death penalty to a few years of harsh labor. Furthermore, a series of decrees and laws on land reform has been released, detailing the last phase of the land revolution, the redistribution of agricultural land."
 North_Vietnam_3_desc:0 "\nAfter the radicalization of the land reform by elements of the Communist Party of Vietnam, it hasn't taken long for the executions and the social isolation of landlords to begin. With a Politburo document being released that details that one per a thousand people of the total population must be executed, on the grounds of them being landlords or otherwise collaborating with landlords; it has been estimated that fifteen thousand reactionaries and landlords are dead. The VWP has thus far started a campaign on the rectification of errors after the execution of these landlords, many of which have been falsely or wrongly sentenced to death. With a three-phase operation, it has re-classified peasants and has restituted property that has been erroneously expropriated or otherwise making suitable compensation for those mistakes; furthermore, there has been a review, inventory and concentrated re-indoctrination of local personnel."

 Cambodia_Com_1_desc:0 "\nAfter the separation of the Indochinese Communist Party into Lao, Vietnamese and Cambodian counterparts, the decision to form a Cambodian communist party was taken. Son Ngoc Minh was appointed the Acting Chairman of the party, being initially named the Khmer People's Revolutionary Party. It is rumored that the KPRP and the Viet Minh are tied together and maintain very strong relations; and the KPRP is heavily supporting the Vietnamese party in this initial phase of its existence."
 Cambodia_Com_2_desc:0 "A long march has been initiated; the failure of the Viet Minh to negotiate a political role for the KPRP in the Geneva Conference has prompted the Acting Chairman of the KPRP, Son Ngoc Minh, to make a march to North Vietnam with a thousand men. The men that remained in Cambodia have formed a legal political party, the Krom Pracheachon. During the formation of Pracheachon, two new leaders that will manage the party have emerged, Tou Samouth of the Urban Committee and Sieu Heng of the Rural Committee; the Urban Committee has warm views on Norodom Sihanouk and is endorsed by North Vietnam while Sieu Heng was vehemently against Norodom and advocates a struggle to overthrow the \"feudalist\" Sihanouk."

 Bangkok_Plot_1_desc:0 "\nNorodom Sihanouk, King of Cambodia, was deposed by right-wing generals and politicians Son Ngoc Thanh, Sam Sary and regional Cambodian warlord and governor Dap Chhuon; Son Ngoc Thanh amassed anti-communist and anti-monarchist guerillas in the southern areas of Cambodia while Chhuon sparked an uprising in the north-east. While the King's troops were sent out to deal with the rebellion, the guerillas led by Thanh invaded Phnom Penh and seized the Palace; a declaration by Son Ngoc Thanh proclaimed the formation of the Khmer Republic, while the King is nowhere to be found, it is likely that he escaped with his family far away from Cambodia. Thailand, South Vietnam and the United States are all eager to initiate talks with the new government."
 Bangkok_Plot_2_desc:0 "\nSon Ngoc Thanh, a Cambodian right-wing general, along with Sam Sary and regional Cambodian warlord, and governor, Dap Chhuon, have attempted to remove the King of Cambodia, Norodom Sihanouk, from his place as the Head of State and King of the nation; while Thanh was massing anti-communist and anti-monarchist guerrillas in the south of the nation, most of them minorities from the Khmer Krom, Chhuon was to start an uprising in the north-east. The plan was foiled by the intelligence services of Norodom Sihanouk which attempted to arrest Chhuon, before he escaped and was later captured -  dying of injuries later after being interrogated. Both Sary and Thanh escaped the country while an US citizen and alleged radio operator Victor Matsui was arrested, which prompted Norodom to accuse the CIA of sparking a coup against him due to warm relations with the People's Republic of China. Pictures of Chhuon's corpse were taken and shown in Phnom Penh, a final mark of an attempted coup against Norodom; supporters of the regime have accused Thailand, South Vietnam and the United States of attempting to depose the Cambodian leader."
 
 Mon_Cambodia_1_desc:0 "An outspoken critic of Prince Norodom Sihanouk due to his détente with the People's Republic of China, a nationalist and right-wing general, Dap Chhuon was the Internal Security Minister and Governor of Siem Reap Province during the 1950s. After being dropped from the Cabinet, he increasingly broke his ties with the Norodom regime, culminating in the Bangkok Plot. He was arrested, interrogated and subsequently died of his injures; many claim that Lon Nol, a Cambodian general and politician, executed him due to fears of being implicated in the Bangkok Plot himself."
 Mon_Cambodia_2_desc:0 "Nop Bophann, a journalist, editor of the newspaper Pracheachon and one of the representatives of the left-wing United Issarak Front was shot and killed today. Being killed outside a military barrack in Phnom Penh, he was a dangerous element of the Norodom Sihanouk administration due to his support of a guerilla movement which once held half of the Cambodian territory; many claim that the Prince himself ordered his death while he, of course, denies these claims vehemently and claims that he was an admirer of Bophann's determination."
 Mon_Cambodia_3_desc:0 "The head of the Urban Committee of Pracheachon, Tou Samouth, has disappeared from the entire nation. Not a single trace of the leftist politician and mentor of prominent Communist leader, Saloth Sar, better known as Pol Pot, has been found. An intelligent man with a moderate temperament, he was notorious for calling for peaceful negotiations with the King, Norodom Sihanouk, and for recognizing him as a figure of stability and national unity. Many from Pol Pot's circle claims that Lon Nol, a Cambodian military general, arrested and executed him; while rumors, even inside the party, claim that Pol Pot was the one that arranged for the assassination of his former mentor and ally. Whatever the real reason for Tou Samouth's disappearance and subsequent death, it is now buried between stacks of documents in Cambodia."
