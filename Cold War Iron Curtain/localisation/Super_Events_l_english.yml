  SUPER_EVENT_SOVIET_AFGHAN_WAR_DESC:0 "We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would...That secret operation was an excellent idea.

The States of Europe must therefore form a federation or a European entity that would make them into a common economic unit."
