  SUPER_EVENT_ANGOLAN_CIVIL_WAR_DESC:0 "The story is known perfectly well, for many years now the imperialists, when they realized that one day that colony could be liberated, they started organizing their movements.

  SUPER_EVENT_SOVIET_AFGHAN_WAR_DESC:0 "We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would...That secret operation was an excellent idea.

  SUPER_EVENT_ARABIAN_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "One of the strongest natural proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise, she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ass for a lion.\n\n-Thomas Paine"

The countries of Europe are not strong enough individually to be able to guarantee prosperity and social development for their peoples. The States of Europe must therefore form a federation or a European entity that would make them into a common economic unit."
