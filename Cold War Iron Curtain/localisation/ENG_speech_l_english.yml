 attlee_anti_war_desc:0 "Five years of war inflicted great damage on our country. Valuable lives were lost. Much wealth was destroyed. Our trade was disrupted. Clearly there will be hardships and shortages of many things to be endured. To achieve recovery we require a great effort on the part of all the men and women of Britain during the last four and a half years a very fine effort has been made production in industry and agriculture has been greatly increased and the opportunity of working has been afforded to all and the vast majority has worked well the inevitable hardships and shortages have been as far as possible shared by all but so of the advantages the great social security scheme has been applied to all the result of Labor's policy is seen in the health of the people especially of the children and the babies never have they been so fine yes Mr. Churchill calls this the sharing misery and the question to be decided at this election is whether Labor's policy of fair shares for all is to continue or whether as under previous Conservative government's the benefits are to go to one section of the people and the misery to another I ask you to help us to continue the work of a recovery so well begun."
 attlee_korean_war:0 "Address the Korean War"
 attlee_korean_war_desc:0 "We are faced with a direct challenge to the authority of the United Nations, an act of aggression ahs been committed. Now you can make all kinds of special meetings, you can say the South Korean government or the American one, I agree. Because the person isn't a very good character, it doesn't excuse the person tries to murder him. You can say that China, the new China is not on the Security Council. It doesn't affect or alter the fact of aggression. And if the United Nations organization was not all the way the old League of Nations, it was absolutely necessary a halt should be called. And more than fifty other nations are backing them up in this effort to preserve world peace. This means risks and danger, any other cause were meant risks and danger. I'm quite sure that if we won, the authority in the world that is greater than the world of aggressor. We have got to say here and now, the aggression will not succeed."

 churchill_king_death:0 "Speech at King George VI's Death"
 churchill_king_death_desc:0 "During these last months the King walked with death as if death were a companion, an acquaintance whom he recognized and did not fear. In the end death came as a friend, and after a happy day of sunshine and sport, and after \"good night\" to those who loved him best, he fell asleep as every man or woman who strives to fear God and nothing else in the world may hope to do. I, whose youth was passed in the august, unchallenged and tranquil glories of the Victorian era, may well feel a thrill in invoking once more the prayer and the anthem, \"God save the Queen!"
