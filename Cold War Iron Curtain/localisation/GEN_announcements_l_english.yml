 usa_address_korean_war_desc:0 "On Sunday, June 25th, Communist forces attacked the Republic of Korea. This attack has made it clear, beyond all doubt, that the international Communist movement is willing to use armed invasion to conquer independent nations. An act of aggression such as this creates a very real danger to the security of all free nations. The Communist invasion was launched in great force, with planes, tanks, and artillery. The size of the attack, and the speed with which it was followed up, make it perfectly plain that it had been plotted long in advance. Fifty-two of the 59 countries which are members of the United Nations have given their support to the action taken by the Security Council to restore peace in Korea. Under the flag of the United Nations a unified command has been established for all forces of the members of the United Nations fighting in Korea. Gen. Douglas MacArthur is the commander of this combined force. The prompt action of the United Nations to put down lawless aggression, and the prompt response to this action by free peoples all over the world, will stand as a landmark in mankind's long search for a rule of law among nations. Furthermore, the fact that Communist forces have invaded Korea is a warning that there may be similar acts of aggression in other parts of the world. The free nations must be on their guard, more than ever before, against this kind of sneak attack."

 eng_address_korean_war_desc:0 "We are faced with a direct challenge to the authority of the United Nations, an act of aggression ahs been committed. Now you can make all kinds of special meetings, you can say the South Korean government or the American one, I agree. Because the person isn't a very good character, it doesn't excuse the person tries to murder him. You can say that China, the new China is not on the security countil. It doesn't affect or alter the fact of aggression. And if the United Nations organization was not all the way the old League of Nations, it was absolutely necessary a halt should be called. And more than fifty other nations are backing them up in this effort to preserve world peace. This means risks and danger, any other cause were meant risks and danger. I'm quite sure that if we won, the authority in the world that is greater than the world of aggressor. We have got to say here and now, the aggression will not succeed."

We can not let down our aware no matter what happens in Korea. We must have men, ships, planes, tanks and and bombs on ready for any emergency and if we have them we will have to use them!"

 eng_address_king_death_desc:0 "During these last months the King walked with death as if death were a companion, an acquaintance whom he recognized and did not fear. In the end death came as a friend, and after a happy day of sunshine and sport, and after \"good night\" to those who loved him best, he fell asleep as every man or woman who strives to fear God and nothing else in the world may hope to do. I, whose youth was passed in the august, unchallenged and tranquil glories of the Victorian era, may well feel a thrill in invoking once more the prayer and the anthem, \"God save the Queen!"
