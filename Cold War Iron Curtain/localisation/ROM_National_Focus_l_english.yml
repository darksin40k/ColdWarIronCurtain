 Romania_Purge.1.d:0 "Since the fall of the Nazi empire, the new ruling party of [ROM.GetNameDef] has been at war from within. The communist infighting between the Muscovite wing and the Prison wing has been at a status quo since the destruction of the bourgeoisie Secretariat wing in 1948. However, now that [ROM.GetLeader] has gained backing from [SOV.GetLeader], and has emerged victorious over leader of the Muscovite wing Ana Pauker, the [ROM.GetRulingParty] has begun a series of violent purges against the Muscovite wing under accusations of right wing deviationism. Out of all of the one million party members, between 300 000 and 465 000 have been removed, almost half of the party. With this, [ROM.GetLeader] is secure in his dominance of Romania."
 Romania_Purge.2.d:0 "Although [SOV.GetLeader] has been backing his allies in eastern Europe fervently, the winds are now changing in [ROM.GetNameDef]. Under Gheroghe Gheorghiu-Dej's iron fist, opposition has been crushed and the record has been rewritten. However, his aggressively anti-semitic campaign against Ana Pauker's more moderate policies has drawn more attention than he thought, and the idea that maybe he is not the most stable ruler of [ROM.GetNameDef] has spread through all levels of the communist world. Ana Pauker has spearheaded an armed removal of the paranoid Gheorghiu-Dej, with the support of [SOV.GetLeader]. Though the disgraced First Secretary had fortified himself in his office, declaring all who stood against him traitors, he was successfully removed in chains. Now that Gheorghiu-Dej has been imprisoned, Ana Pauker has been declared the new First Secretary with the backing of [SOV.GetLeader]."
 Romania_Purge.3.d:0 "Following [SOV.GetLeader]'s speech about Stalin and his cult of personality, many of the Warsaw Pact countries have begun a process of removing authority figures that embody Stalin's methods. Romania has followed a similar path in the wake of the 20th Congress, working to remove the power hungry Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and his dictatorial methods in favor of a new First Secretary and a more modern version of Communism. Although Gheorghiu-Dej fought tooth and nail on perceived threats from revisionists and liberal anarchy, he has been overthrown with backing from [SOV.GetLeader] and replaced with [ROM.GetLeader]. "
 Romania_Purge.4.d:0 "The unofficial leader of the Romanian Communist party Ana Pauker has been arrested by [ROM.GetLeader] as a part of a greater plan from the mind of [SOV.GetLeader] in order to consolidate [SOV.GetNameDef]'s power in Eastern Europe. The charges against Ana Pauker have focused especially on her support of "the subversive and espionage activities of the Israeli Legation and of the Zionists in the country," and of divulging secrets to the west. She has disappeared into a Romanian prison, surrounded by rumors of torture and interrogation."
 Romania_Purge.5.d:0 "The leader of the long defunct Secretariat wing Lucretiu Patrascanu has been executed over accusations of being influenced by bourgeoisie elements and even United States agents.  Patrascanu has been imprisoned by the state since 1948 over these charges until his recent trial, which he showed up to with an amputated leg. The haggard leader stubbornly refused to accept a lawyer, or even defend himself, saying only that he \"spit on the charges\" brought against him. With Patrascanu's trial and execution, a wave of new arrests has taken the country, directed at any and all allies of Patrascanu and any opposition to the [ROM.GetRulingParty]."
