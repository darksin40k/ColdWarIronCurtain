 space_race_decision_event.1.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader][ROOT.GetName] Launches Unmanned Array into Space"
 space_race_decision_event.1.d:0 "Following extensive investment in a nationalized space program, [ROOT.GetLeader] announced the successful launch of an unmanned array into Earth's orbit.\nWith the recent overtures from both the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics towards heavy investment in their respective space programs, it is clear the emerging global space race has spurred on nations from across the world to engage in the research and development of space faring technology and science.\nWhile the success of the current program might seem rudimentary in nature, clearly this is only the beginning of a new entry in the global space race, with more investment in the [Root.GetAdjective] space program all but assured for the future!\n\n(on your marks...)"
 space_race_decision_event.1.a:0 "This is amazing"
 space_race_decision_event.2.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader][ROOT.GetName] Launches Animal into Space"
 space_race_decision_event.2.d:0 "After the recent success of the [Root.GetAdjective] Space Program in previous years, [ROOT.GetLeader] has upped the ante of [ROOT.GetName]'s role in the global space race with the announcement of the successful launch of a live animal into Earth's orbit.\nFollowing a brief fear concerning the plight of the animal, the aspiring cosmonaut was successfully recovered after its vessel landed safely off the coast of the Mediterranean, following a successful 9 hour flight mission in Earth's orbit.\nThis moment marks a significant victory in the [Root.GetAdjective] Space Program; with continued investment in the national space program, it might not be long before the next great step for [ROOT.GetName] in the global technological race.\n\n(...Get Set...)"

 space_race_decision_event.3.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Man in Space!"
 space_race_decision_event.3.d:0 "In perhaps one of the most important moments in the history of [ROOT.GetName], [ROOT.GetLeader] has announced the successful launch of a manned space craft into orbit.\nAfter an extensive period of preliminary trails, the [Root.GetAdjective] national space program successfully outfitted the one man module with the necessary equipment for zero gravity, trans-atmospheric orbital flight. The pilot extracted soon after from their ocean landing following the mission's success.\nThe pilot, along with the many minds behind [ROOT.GetName]'s space program, have been hailed as heroes of the nation, with [ROOT.GetLeader] himself making arrangements to award medals to the men and women responsible for this great and unparalleled contribution to both national and human history and progress.\n\n(...and they're off!...)"

 space_race_decision_event.4.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader]Geosynchronous Orbit achieved by [ROOT.GetName]'s Space Program"
 space_race_decision_event.4.d:0 "Intense calculations and testing on the part of the [Root.GetAdjective] intelligentsia have born fruit. [ROOT.GetLeader] announced that a [Root.GetAdjective] satellite array has achieved geosynchronous orbit, managing to match its planetary orbit with that of the rotation of the Earth.\nNecessitating much more planning and specificity on the part of the minds behind the [Root.GetAdjective] space program, the success of the project opens further opportunities for expansion of the program.\nTalks of more experimentation with manned space projects are in the works.\n\n(...and the crowd goes wild!...)"

 space_race_decision_event.5.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader][Root.GetAdjective] Orbital Rendezvous"
 space_race_decision_event.5.d:0 "The most recent endeavors by the [Root.GetAdjective] space program has resulted in a significant moment in foreign affairs, both on Earth and above!\n[Root.GetAdjective] astronauts successfully piloted their space craft through orbit to conduct on orbital rendezvous with another group of astronauts about a manned [Root.GetAdjective] satellite.\nTruly, this event marks a landmark moment for [ROOT.GetName]'s status on the world stage. Clearly, the efforts on the part of the national space program has elevated [ROOT.GetName] in the eyes of the great powers of world, with more to come in the near future.\n\n(...[ROOT.GetName] takes the lead!...)"
