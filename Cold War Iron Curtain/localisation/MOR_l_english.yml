The French protectorate led to new development projects and education advancements. Moroccan soldiers played a major role in both World Wars for the French state. However, the French occupation also sparked a series of revolts and unrest. The Moroccan nationalist parties began emerging in the 1930s, launching a non-violent movement for independence. Hopes for independence after World War II were dashed, leading to increasing violence by nationalist activists. The Tangier Speech by Sultan Muhammad V called for decolonization and independence. The aftermath saw several massacres conducted by French forces in Casablanca. Tensions are high as Moroccans increasingly view armed resistance as the only means forward. General Alphonse Juin must decide how to maintain French control in spite of rising nationalist unrest or prepare for a dignified French exit from the region.\n\nSpanish rule in Morocco began in the early twentieth century when Spain and France divided the country into separate spheres of influence. The 1920s saw Spain embroiled in the Rif War, which they won only after suffering heavy casualties. The Spanish Civil War saw Moroccan soldiers serve Spanish dictator Francisco Franco loyally. After his victory, Franco rewarded the territory with liberal policies. Moroccan nationalist parties emerged and began publicly pushing for independence. The Tangier Speech by Sultan Muhammad V called for decolonization and independence. Although indirectly focused on the French, many Moroccans in the Spanish territory were also inspired, spurring more nationalist unrest. General Rafael Garcia Valino must decide how to mobilize local support to maintain Spanish control in the face of rising nationalist unrest or prepare for a dignified Spanish exit.§!"

 MOR_JEWISH_TT_DESC:0 "§CThe Moroccan Jewish community settled in the region for many generations. The advent of French colonialism saw many Jewish families take advantage of European institutions, especially schools. The Sultan traditionally held positive ties with the Jewish community, notably aiding them during World War II. However, the emergence of Israel and return of French colonial oversight has strained relations. Arab nationalists increasingly view Israel as a major threat and see the Moroccan Jews as a potential fifth column. They advocate the government more harshly control the Jewish community. Among Moroccan anti-colonial activists, they see the Jewish community as closely allied with the French and a threat to Moroccan independence. For the Jewish community, the French are seen increasingly as their key protectors and many now see migration as the only means for their protection. The government must decide how to calm the anxiety of Moroccan Jews or support those policies advocated by the Arab nationalists and anti-colonial advocates.§!"

 MOR_FACTION_1_DESC:0 "Led by famed anti-colonial fighter and Rift War veteran Abd el-Karim, the Liberation Committee of the Arab Maghreb established its main office in Cairo. The organization embraces Arab nationalism, advocating the unification of the Maghreb. The group is popular among young, urban intellectuals and those advocating for armed resistance to the colonial powers. They are especially popular in the areas controlled or previously influenced by Spain. Their supporters oppose local Arabs and Berbers they view as reactionary or collaborationist, such as traditional rural rulers and the royal government. For the group to grow it must not only challenge the colonial powers but also convince the people to embrace the new pan-Arabist nationalism sweeping across the Arab World."
 MOR_FACTION_2_DESC:0 "Thami El Glaoui leads the rural pashas who have increasingly shown a resistance to the nationalist parties. For decades, these pashas have thrived under French colonial rule. The French have provided autonomy and protection, allowing the pashas to consolidate their power over rural communities and accumulate personal wealth. Mobilizing their supporters will allow them to maintain their autonomy and prevent nationalist and royal influence from spreading to their areas. However, as France and Spain consider new reforms, they risk alienating the pashas. With the situation changing, Thami El Glaoui must consider how he will maintain his autonomy, by supporting one of the other factions or even seize power to preserve the power of the pashas."
 MOR_FACTION_3_DESC:0 "The French Protectorate of Morocco must deal with rising unrest among the Moroccan population. Nationalist fervor is sweeping among the people, especially among the urban, working class Arabs. However, the French can count on support from settlers and the small Jewish communities present within the protectorate. Over the previous decades, the government has established strong ties among certain rural communities through military recruitment. These soldiers played pivotal roles in recent French colonial and military conflicts. These men can be counted upon to remain loyal to preserve French rule. They wish to maintain the social and economic benefits of their loyalty."
 MOR_FACTION_4_DESC:0 "The Spanish Protectorate of Morocco faces rising nationalist unrest among the people, especially among urban Moroccan Muslims. Along with some settler populations, the Spanish can call on the minority Moroccan Jewish community. Like the French, the Spanish established strong connections with rural Moroccan communities through military recruitment. These soldiers proved immensely loyal and effective during the Spanish Civil War. Spain can count on the loyalty of these soldiers to support a continuation of Spanish rule in order to preserve their relative independence and monetary support."
 MOR_FACTION_5_DESC:0 "In the Tangier Speech, Sultan Muhammad V explicitly stated his support for Moroccan independence. He is working closely with Allal al-Fassi and his nationalist Istiqlal Party. The party is popular among urban Arab and Berbers. The faction also enjoys support from traditional Moroccan rulers who have pledged loyalty to the royal family for many generations. With its strong local ties and international legitimacy, the Sultan must decide on how to balance his approach to other Moroccan factions and the colonial regimes. Moving for independence too abruptly could provoke negative consequences, but remaining idle during this moment of anti-colonial fervor may leave them struggling to control the destiny of the Moroccan nation."

The advent of French colonialism saw many Jewish families take advantage of European institutions, especially schools. The Sultan traditionally held positive ties with the Jewish community, notably aiding them during World War II. However, the emergence of Israel and return of French colonial oversight has strained relations. Arab nationalists increasingly view Israel as a major threat and see the Moroccan Jews as a potential fifth column. They advocate the government more harshly control the Jewish community. Among Moroccan anti-colonial activists, they see the Jewish community as closely allied with the French and a threat to Moroccan independence. For the Jewish community, the French are seen increasingly as their key protectors and many now see migration as the only means for their protection. The government must decide how to calm the anxiety of Moroccan Jews or support those policies advocated by the Arab nationalists and anti-colonial advocates."
