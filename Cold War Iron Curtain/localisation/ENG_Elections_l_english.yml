 CWelect.1.t:0 "Election of 1950 - Clement Attlee v. Winston Churchill"
 CWelect.1.d:0 "The election of 1945, with the fall of Hitler's European Reich, set many precedents. Labor secured a large majority of Churchill-aligned Conservatives and the Liberal Party was shrunk to a mere third party and this situation carried us to this day. But that was 1945, it is now 1950 and the parties have changed. Labor has nationalized key industries and created the NHS, while the Conservatives are still led by Winston Churchill. The ballots are counted and..."

After years in Parliament and many cabinet positions, he was chosen in 1940 to replace Neville Chamberlain as prime minister, and his charisma and countless speeches got the British people through the war and all it curtailed. Winston Churchill and his career is much more defined by the Second World War than anything else, and that may be a good thing."

 CWelect.8.b:0 "The Tories will protect us! Alec Douglas-Home!"
 Alec_Douglas-Home:0 "Coming as an MP from the House of Lords as the Baron of the Hirsel, Alec took over after the resignation of Harold MacMillan. He has been in the past an aide to Prime Minister Chamberlain. Alec looks to be much more autocratic than his competition, and that may be his downfall..."
 Harold_Wilson:0 "Harold Wilson has long served in cabinets. As soon as he became an elected MP, he was put on Mr. Attlee's cabinet and shadow council, and now he has been elected Labor's leader. Ever since the death of Hugh Gaitskell, he has tried to rebrand Labor into moderate socialism."
