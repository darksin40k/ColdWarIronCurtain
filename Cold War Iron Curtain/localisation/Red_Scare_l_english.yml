 RED_SCARE.1:0 "The House Committee for Un-American Activities has started proceedings about the influence of communism in Hollywood. The Committee expects to hold over a week of hearings into the problem and have called actors, writers, directors, producers, and executives to testify. The Committee decided to hold these hearings following concerns from the public over recent films glorifying communistic ideas. Several publications have also written exposes about the strong communist leadings prevalent across the film industry. Hollywood is expected to do its patriotic duty and participate, however, there are rumors some are going to refuse to testify…"
 RED_SCARE.2:0 "During the recent hearings over communist influence in Hollywood, ten of those called to testify refused to answer questions and were charged with contempt of Congress. During the proceedings executives agreed that some recent films could be perceived as pro-Soviet but they argued those films were from the war when the Soviets were allies. One executive noted a film criticized by the committee had actually been made at the request of the White House. Despite these embarrassing moments, most Americans supported the investigation and Hollywood executives are said to be instituting new practices to ensure communist influences are rooted out. Already there are reports of Hollywood executives compiling a blacklist and the ten who refused to testify are said to be the first on the list."
 RED_SCARE.3:0 "The House Committee for Un-American Activities heard explosive testimony from ex-Communist Party of the United States members. The testimony of Whitaker Chambers has received a lot of attention. The former communist and NKVD spy revealed the extensive infiltration of communists and Soviet spies in the highest echelons of the federal government. He specifically claimed Alger Hiss, a former federal official and diplomat was a communist. Alger Hiss condemned Chambers, starting a libel case against him. In response, Chambers called Hiss a Soviet spy leading the press to accuse Hiss of undermining the post-war situation as he served during the critical Yalta Conference. To support his claims, Chambers produced documents he claims are handwritten by Hiss with critical information related to American foreign policy."
 RED_SCARE.4:0 "A Grand Jury recently charged Alger Hiss with two counts of perjury, noting he could not be charged with espionage due to statute of limitations. After two trials, Hiss was finally convicted and sentenced to five years. The high-profile trials saw testimonies from expert witnesses and leading politicians, raising public fear of Soviet infiltration of the government. The jury was convinced of the authenticity of several documents revealed by Whitaker Chambers that revealed Hiss had copied sensitive documents for Moscow. Alger Hiss continued to deny the accusations despite the convictions. Dean Acheson gave a public statement condemning the conviction."
 RED_SCARE.5:0 "In a secret presentation, the President and senior security officials were informed of details regarding the Venona Project. The Venona Project was setup in 1943 to decrypt Soviet messages and track their espionage operations directed towards the United States. The project has decrypted a number of Soviet intelligence cabals and a picture has emerged of intensive espionage efforts by the Soviet Union against the United States. The President was informed the government must remain vigilant and that a number of arrests will soon be made of suspected wartime spies who may have betrayed state secrets. The Soviets are alleged to have had spies in most wartime organizations, especially those related to war production. The project cannot be revealed in court proceedings or to the public in order not to compromise this critical operation."
 RED_SCARE.6:0 "The President signed Executive Order 9835 which will establish a loyalty program in the United States. The program will investigate millions of federal employees and hopefully remove any with communist or disloyal inclinations. The order is meant to showcase the anti-communist focus of the President and halt criticism that the government is weak on the Soviet threat. The policy is also meant to shore up public support for the growing international confrontation between the United States and Soviet Union. Although the public largely supports the decision, there are some who criticize the program for infringing on individual rights. The President must decide on how intensely to conduct these loyalty reviews."
 RED_SCARE.7:0 "The new Executive Order 9835 started loyalty reviews of all federal employees. The early reports have noted an intense scrutiny by investigators. Although the number of people identified as disloyal is expected to be very small, some federal employees are raising concerns over the intensity of the questions. Some who support more leftist policies fear the intense questioning may turn off some from government service and fear their own promotions within the federal government could be affected by these reviews. Regardless, the press and congress appear satisfied with the process."
 RED_SCARE.8:0 "The new Executive Order 9835 started loyalty reviews of all federal employees. The early reports have noted a lax scrutiny by investigators. The number of federal employees identified as disloyal is expected to be very small, but some federal officials are raising concerns. They fear the reviews lack scrutiny and may enable communist elements to continue their infiltration of the government. They accuse the President of playing politics and only pretending to take the communist threat seriously. The national press has picked up on this story and the White House is facing media and congressional backlash."
 RED_SCARE.9:0 "The Director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover has requested permission from the White House and Justice Department to approve efforts of expanding FBI operations against domestic communists. He argued recent court cases have revealed the alarming extent of Soviet sponsored communist infiltration across all fabrics of American society. Although he lauds the recent initiative by the White House to start loyalty screenings, he believes the FBI can go beyond that to better protect the American people and our way of life. Some advisors to the President fear Hoover may be seeking to use communism as an excuse to expand his powers and crackdown on civil rights groups and other organizations that he construes as being leftist. They also argue the Justice Department is more than capable of prosecuting and investigating enemies of the United States."
 RED_SCARE.10:0 "The President informed FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover that it recognizes the threat and agrees that the FBI should take a more important role in the uncovering of communist and foreign communist agents in the United States. The FBI Director was said to be thrilled and explained he planned on deploying undercover agents across the country, with a focus on especially vulnerable communities, such as university campuses and minority neighborhoods. He noted these communities were naturally sympathetic to leftist ideology and he would ensure the communists did not find a steady pool of recruits form within the country."
 RED_SCARE.11:0 "The White House informed J. Edgar Hoover that it too is very concerned with communist and Soviet domestic threats. However, it noted the successful role of multiple agencies and the Justice Department in particular in uncovering many of the recent plots. It noted the FBI had many other responsibilities and challenges and adding more to their plate would risk overwhelming the organization. The President firmly informed Hoover that the FBI should continue to work with other agencies and continue its important responsibility of conducting loyalty reviews. The FBI Director was said to be infuriated following the meeting and leaked the details to the national press."
 RED_SCARE.12:0 "Since World War II, our intelligence agencies have successfully uncovered several major Soviet espionage rings in the country. It is clear the Soviets have for years sought to steal state secrets and gain information on the United States. In a recent security briefing, it became clear that more such cells are operating in the country and will soon be exposed. The President must decide whether these cells should continue to be monitored, which can provide valuable intelligence but will keep these groups active. Or if we should continue do direct the Justice Department to open cases and breakup these cells as soon as they are identified. Some of the senior intelligence leaders argue the cells should be uncovered and publicly tried as this will ensure public opinion remains firmly against the communists. Others fear such cases, especially back to back, may cause hysteria and weaken national resolve, they want to continue the surveillance and quietly dismantle these cells."
 RED_SCARE.13:0 "The White House released a statement confirming charges against members of an alleged communist cell bent on armed revolution against the United States. The group had been surveilled for years and its members were arrested following reports the cell planned to acquire arms. The press has publicized the arrests, however, public outrage is far lower than it would have been only a few years earlier. The fear of an imminent communist or Soviet takeover through internal agents has subsided, as there have not been major attacks and the wartime Soviet spy rings have long been prosecuted. In a security briefing, the President was told the surveillance operations would continue, but most of the most dangerous cells have been removed."
 RED_SCARE.14:0 "11 leaders of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) were indicted under the 1940 Smith Act for conspiring to overthrow the government. The arrests follow recent public trials of Soviet spies and congressional hearings on communist infiltrators across American society. The FBI, under J. Edgar Hoover was said to be instrumental in collecting evidence for this case. Leaks to the media suggest the FBI used informants, among other investigative tools to complete its investigation. All those arrested are members of the National Board for the CPUSA. A source within the investigative team suggests the figure of those charged may increase to over a hundred. The news has shocked the public, especially after hearing the CPUSA was said to have 80,000 members during the war."
 RED_SCARE.15:0 "The trial of Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) leaders intensified with the five defense attorneys questioning the purpose of the trial and failure of the court to secure an unbiased jury or maintain order. This is in reference to what many reporters are calling a carnival like atmosphere as the court remains packed with reporters and onlookers, many hurling insults at the defendants and their lawyers. The accused CPUSA leaders are being defended by five volunteer lawyers who argue the case is against basic principles of free speech and human rights. The prosecution alleges the defendants actively worked with the Soviet Union and had been plotting an armed revolution against the United States since 1945. Newspapers and editorials are largely supporting the prosecution."
 RED_SCARE.16:0 "The trial of Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) leaders continues to face criticism from free speech advocates and civil rights leaders who note how news of other convictions of Soviet spies are being widely shared at the courthouse. The recent convictions, in cases not related to the current trial, have fed public anxiety towards communist infiltration and allegedly are manipulating the public to more openly support the prosecution. The defense attorneys note it is bizarre how unrelated cases and their verdicts are finding their way to the courthouse and considering the amount of reporters and spectators, how can the jury not be influenced."
 RED_SCARE.17:0 "For the second time during the trial of Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) leaders, the judge declared all five defense attorneys will be held for contempt of court and punished at the conclusion of the trial. This comes after the defense once again question the validity and legitimacy of the proceedings, noting issues with the jury selection process and the at times disruptive atmosphere of the spectators watching. The judge has continuously denied these claims and accuses the defense of making a mockery of the court and launching delaying tactics. Some prominent lawyers have voiced concern over the actions of the judge."
 RED_SCARE.18:0 "The trial of Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) leaders ended with the jury finding all defendants guilty. Ten of those convicted were fined and sentenced to five years in prison. The eleventh, World War II veteran Robert Thompson, was given three years out of consideration for his wartime service. The judge then sentenced all five defense attorneys for contempt of court, giving them sentences ranging from one month to six months in prison. The public largely supporters the convictions, however, legal observers were disappointed by the sentencing, which they say showed a judge showing a vindictive character to the defense lawyers. Some lawyers went as far to agree with the assertion by a defendant that the court as a kangaroo court. Regardless, the public appears to back the convictions as an example of justice being upheld."
 RED_SCARE.19:0 "In an explosive speech given in West Virginia during Lincoln Day, Senator Joseph McCarthy waved a piece of paper on which, he claimed, was a list of 205 State Department workers suspected of being communists. He noted that despite being identified communist sympathizers, they remained in their positions and are shaping American foreign policy. He called for the federal government to stiffen its resolve and remove all communist sympathizers from federal agencies. The speech has resulted in a lot of public attention and McCarthy is now being seen as among the leading anti-communist crusaders in the Senate."
 RED_SCARE.20:0 "The United States Senate has created the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee to investigate the enforcement of the Internal Security Act and other laws related to espionage, infiltration, and sabotage against the United States of America. The committee is being led by Senator Patrick McCarran. The committee is expected to play a major role in uncovering communist threats to the United States. Senator Joseph McCarthy, the firebrand anti-communist crusader, is not on the committee. Many insiders note the Republican Party leadership is cautious of McCarthy and his aggressive accusations, which is why they ensured he would not be on the committee."
 RED_SCARE.21:0 "The powerful veterans group, the American Legion declared its full-hearted support to all investigations of communists in the United States and Soviet spies. The group notes that communism is the antithesis of American democracy and liberty. Thousands of American soldiers have given their lives to defend these ideas and millions have served to preserve it. Out of respect for those sacrifices, it is the duty of the American government to fully investigate and destroy these threats to the United States. With this endorsement by the influential group, politicians on both sides of the aisle will be openly supporting the investigations to not lose the vote of veterans who constitute a large voting block across the country."
 RED_SCARE.22:0 "A Grand Jury has indicted both Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage and betraying the United States. The couple are both already in custody after Julius was arrested several months ago following an FBI investigation that identified him as a Soviet spy. The Grand Jury was then setup and during those proceedings, Ethel Rosenberg as also arrested after she testified. The husband and wife will soon be brought to trial as the government accuses both of leading a powerful spy ring that gave American nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union during the war. Julius Rosenberg, who worked for the Army during the war, is accused of recruiting agents from the top-secret Manhattan Project and providing invaluable information to the Soviet Union. Ethel Rosenburg is accused of assisting her husband in these efforts."
 RED_SCARE.23:0 "The trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg opened in New York. The trial is expected to feature the testimony of David Greenglass, who during his own interrogation admitted to giving information to Soviet agents through Julius Rosenberg. The Rosenbergs were only discovered for their alleged wartime espionage following the recent confession of a Manhattan Project scientist. Julius and Ethel are accused of organizing a powerful Soviet spy ring that helped the Soviets quickly end the American nuclear monopoly. The public is said to be outraged at how easily the Soviets appeared to infiltrate the most secret wartime operation and senior officials accuse these spies of enabling the Soviets to rapidly catch up to the United States in nuclear technology. The Rosenbergs defiantly deny the accusations and are expected to plead the fifth amendment at trial."
 RED_SCARE.24:0 "The jury at the closely followed espionage trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg found both guilty of murder. The judge in the case has decided to sentence both to death. In his comments, the judge noted that the two had not just committed espionage, but also enabled the Soviet Union to gain a technology that has emboldened communism across the globe, providing it a check to American nuclear power. He stated any American deaths in the post-war turbulence can be blamed on the Rosenburgs and akin to murder and for that also they must be punished. Julius Rosenberg in his own statement, called the trial a sham and claimed he was being setup for political gain. The American people have followed the case closely and are said to be stunned at the extent and ability of Soviet espionage."
 RED_SCARE.25:0 "Most Americans wholeheartedly support the death sentence verdict given to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for their involvement in sharing nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union. However, there is a growing movement calling for clemency for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The campaign is bringing not just communist leaning individuals but also those opposed to the death penalty and humanists. The Pope is also said to be in favor of commuting the sentence and passed his concerns to the President. The campaign has attracted several high profile, international scientists and Nobel Prize winners. The President must decide whether to deny the appeal for clemency or commute the sentences. To commute the sentence would increase the international image of the United States, however, it will lead to public backlash at home."
 RED_SCARE.26:0 "The decision by the President to commute the sentence of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg to life in prison without parole received widespread international praise. However, the press in the United States has eviscerated the President. In addition, there are large protests being held across the United States condemning the decision. Many accuse the President of kowtowing to foreigners and ignoring the wishes of the American people. Others accuse the President of being soft on communists and say the decision will embolden more communists and Soviet spy operations. American war veterans in particular are outraged, noting that the decision was a slap in the face for all Americans who made extreme sacrifices in the war. The President must hope he can recover some of the lost support from the electorate."
 RED_SCARE.27:0 "At the notorious Sing Sing Prison in New York, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were both executed for their crimes against the United States. They were convicted of providing top secret nuclear information to the Soviet Union which accelerated their nuclear program. The bodies were then sent to Brooklyn for a funeral before they were laid to rest at Wellwood Cemetery. They leave behind two minor children. Hundreds attended the funeral service while crowds numbering in the thousands stood outside the cemetery. It is clear the two are being looked at as martyrs for a number of the attendees who see the execution as confirmation that the United States was slowly turning away from its liberal ideals and towards despotic rule. Most Americans however welcomed the news as justice served."
 RED_SCARE.28:0 "Senator Joseph McCarthy, seen by many in his party as an uncontrollable loose-cannon, continues to rise in popularity. Newspapers publish almost daily reports of his claims and accusations of communist infiltration across the government. Many in Congress are following his lead, hoping their own anti-communist rhetoric will gain them attention and votes. Across the United States many Americans are supporting his investigations and taking it further. They are pressuring for the removal of books, movies, or even officials suspected of sympathizing with communists. McCarthy continues to gain popularity and influence, with many dubbing his campaign against communism as McCarthyism."
 RED_SCARE.29:0 "Senator Joseph McCarthy announced to the media his intentions to investigate an Army Signal Corps laboratory in New Jersey. The controversial senator alleges there is a spy ring of scientists within the lab and the Army has failed to properly deal with the situation. After several weeks, McCarthy conceded that there was no evidence of any communist spy rings at the lab. The Army is said to be furious with the accusations by McCarthy. Senator McCarthy however, recently received reports of a Major in the Army Major who was discovered to be a member of a dangerous leftist party but has not been removed from the service. Some McCarthy allies are urging him to stop his investigation of the Army and shift to the State Department, but the senator appears focused on proving the military wrong."
 RED_SCARE.30:0 "Senator McCarthy has started to ask questions of the Army over the case of Major Irving Peress. McCarthy notes that the Army dentist had been discovered to be a former member of the American Labor Party. He also left the section on political affiliations blank in the loyalty form. McCarthy wanted to know why it then took the Army ninety days to remove the Major from the service. Major Peress was granted an honorable separation by his commanding officer. The Army argues it conducted its investigation and process according to procedure, but McCarthy declared  RED_SCARE.:0 "who promoted Peress?" This quote has become a rallying cry to anti-communist and pro-McCarthy supporters across the nation. The Army is said to be seething."
 RED_SCARE.31:0 "The Army recently accused Senator Joseph McCarthy and his chief counsel Roy Cohn of using his position to gain favorable treatment to a former aide who is currently serving as a private. McCarthy condemned the accusations and the incident will be looked into by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The hearings will be broadcast on national television and is expected to last for over a month. McCarthy is confident the hearings will exonerate him, while the Army plans on using information from a lawyer familiar with McCarthy to plan its own strategy. McCarthy must plan his approach"
 RED_SCARE.32:0 "Joseph Nyle Welch, the main attorney for the Army, got into a major spat with Senator Joseph McCarthy during hearings currently being held. Welch challenged Roy Cohn to provide the list of 130 names of communists or subversives within the defense apparatus that McCarthy claims to have. Senator McCarthy responded by saying Welch should instead look into his own law firm as Fred Fisher belonged to a progressive lawyer association. Welch provided a strong defense of Fisher, in the end of his passionate response, he said,  RED_SCARE.:0 "Let us not assassinate this man further, Senator. You have done enough. Have you no sense of decency?" at which the gallery thundered in applause. This emphasizes that the public exposure has opened McCarthy to criticism of being a bully and negative publicity."
 RED_SCARE.33:0 "The Army-McCarthy hearings ended with neither side achieving a victory. The Army was able to prove Roy Cohn had interfered in Army affairs, but Senator McCarthy was exonerated. The Army Secretary was found to have interfered in the recent investigation of the Army Signal Corps Laboratory in New Jersey. However, the publicity of the hearings and media coverage has presented the public of a very unpleasant image of Senator McCarthy. Many now see him as a bully and spinner of lies. The reputation of the Senator and his supporters are at an all-time low."
 RED_SCARE.34:0 "The Army-McCarthy hearings ended with neither side achieving a victory. The Army was able to prove Roy Cohn had interfered in Army affairs, but Senator McCarthy was exonerated. The Army Secretary was found to have interfered in the recent investigation of the Army Signal Corps Laboratory in New Jersey. Many observers were struck by how controlled and at times quiet McCarthy appeared during the proceedings. It appears the counsels of the Army were a bit surprised and had hoped to provoke some outbursts from the Senator. The media coverage was quite extensive but did not really change the opinion of the public that the pursuit of communists must continue."
 RED_SCARE.35:0 "Senator McCarthy recently held hearings calling into the question the loyalty of senior officers in the Army. The Senator noted that suspected communists and subversives were able to pass loyalty-review reports. He questioned why certain officers were dragging their feet or grumbling over procedures meant to defend the United States from internal threats. His comments have gained traction among the American people but also among people in the Pentagon. Some senior defense officials privately worry that as these comments will lead to tensions within the military as officers start to suspect each other."
 RED_SCARE.36:0 "The Senate recently voted to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. He is accused of bullying tactics not befitting a senator and of twisting the truth for his personal political benefit. The vote comes following his failed appearances at the Army-McCarthy Hearings. This combined with his other failed investigations and incendiary accusations have caused both his political and public allies to distance themselves from him. The fact that many of his fellow Republicans supported the vote shows a bipartisan rejection of the senator."
 RED_SCARE.37:0 "The recent senate censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy has followed a much wider public backlash against the senator and McCarthyism. Many editorials now criticize the senator for whipping up public emotions and fear in order to gain public attention. He is also accused of trying to start public witch hunts that run counter to American values. Many of his political opponents are also calling McCarthy out for ruining the image and career of countless people in the country. This response represents that the tide of anti-communist McCarthyism is declining."
 RED_SCARE.38:0 "Senator McCarthy recently launched a series of investigations against the State Department. The Senator claimed hundreds of communists and subversives are shaping foreign policy. The State Department representatives denied the accusations, however, the public at times appeared captivated by the claims. In the end, a number of State Department officials have either resigned or quietly retired to avoid the scrutiny and embarrassment. It appears McCarthyism is continuing strong and McCarthy remains on top."
 RED_SCARE.39:0 "The American people were stunned to hear news that Senator Joseph McCarthy passed away, apparently from acute hepatitis. The late Senator passed away at Bethesda Naval Hospital. For years McCarthy was the face of congressional investigations into communist infiltration and spy rings within the federal government and military. McCarthy became the namesake of McCarthyism and despite his passing, the public interest and concern of communism in the United States continues. Many leading American politicians and figures have released statements expressing their admiration for the late senator."
 RED_SCARE.40:0 "In recent weeks, the military has seen a spat of resignations following hearings held into the loyalty of officers. It appears many in the military, fearing a deeper investigation would affect morale and organization, chose to resign instead of dragging the process out. Several senior generals and admirals have resigned or taken an early retirement. The Pentagon also announced new directives to more streamline investigations and the process of removing subversives from the ranks. The loyalty-review reports are also being updated to be more efficient. Many retired officers have condemned the political interference in the military and fear it would take time for the military to restore its efficiency."
 RED_SCARE.41:0 "Senator Joseph McCarthy passed away, from acute hepatitis at the Bethesda Naval Hospital. Some reporters are suggesting it may have been from alcoholism but this has not been confirmed. Senator McCarthy had been the face of congressional investigations into communist and subversive influences in the federal government. He initially captured the public attention as many Americans were concerned following the revelation of extensive Soviet spy rings during World War II. However, he recently was censured by the senate for his aggressive questioning during hearings and the public largely turned against him as his accusations were often unproven. With his death, many believe the popularity of McCarthyism will end with his death."
