 ita_communist.1.d:0 "The results of the Italian national elections are out, and the Partito Comunista Italiano (PCI) has won in a landslide victory. Led by Palmiro Togliatti, the party has managed to gain 335 seats out of 574, a landslide victory to the Christian Democratic Party and other opponents. The election, heavily influenced by external powers, with the USA backing the Christian Democrats and the Soviet Union backing the PCI, this has  shown the political might of the Soviet Union and no doubt, they have increased their sphere of influence. This election outcome was feared by the NATO members as it another nation has fallen to communism, just like the 1948 communist coup in Czechoslovakia. Togliatti is yet to make an announcement on what stance the country will take next. Some speculate that the new regime might pull out of NATO and even join the Cominform, as Togliatti is a Stalinist. This is indeed a turning point for Europe and may very well be one for the world."
 ita_communist.2.d:0 "Today Palmiro Togliatti officially announced their withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Although [ITA.GetNameDef] was a founding member of the democratic defensive alliance, the recent election of a coalition dominated by the Partito Comunista Italiano into power has alienated the nation from their former allies. Though Palmiro Togliatti said nothing of the future of [ITA.GetNameDef], rumors are already emerging of communiques to [SOV.Capital.GetName], though they are as of yet unconfirmed."
 trieste_crisis.1.d:0 "After many years of reconstruction in both the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Italy, the time has come for the matter concerning the Free Territory of Trieste to be laid to rest, once and for all. Having been divided  into two separate occupation zones; one of them, Zone A, to be patrolled by British and American Forces  along the metropolitan area of Trieste, and the other zone, Zone B, manned by Yugoslav partisans, controlling the rural countryside outside the city limits. Both the Italian and Yugoslav governments, with the aid of the United Nations, are hopeful to reach an accord regarding their continued policy towards Trieste."
 annex_trieste.1.d:0 "Efforts to arrive at a peaceful resolution to the Trieste Crisis came to a screeching halt today as the Italian Army crossed into the Yugoslavian Occupation Zone of Trieste to facilitate their forceful reintegration with the Italian State. After many days of hectic and tension-filled talks between the Adriatic nation states over the status of Trieste and it;s mixed Italian and Slavic population, the Italian government, following months of nationalistic rhetoric from Prime Minister Palla, ordered the Italian Army out of the metropolitan occupation zone and into the largely Slavic countryside, showing little regard for the overtures of Yugoslavian Premier Josip Broz Tito's clear plans of peaceful partition. The eyes of the world, once again, fall upon Belgrade in anticipation of the Federal Government's response to Italian Aggression in Trieste, and with the memories of both the first and second world wars fresh in the minds of both nations, many around the world fear that another violent chapter in the history of Mediterranean may be about to unfold once again."
 italy_resign.1.d:0 "After having only served six months in office, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Pella handed in his resignation today in the Italian capital of Rome. Having served as under former Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi as Under Secretary of Finance in the second and third cabinets and Secretary of Finance under the fourth, he became the target of unrelenting scrutiny from communists and socialists for his attempts at westernizing the Italian post war economy. Following the failure of passing the Cheat Law, he was appointed Prime Minister of Italy wherein he was harshly criticized for his role in the recent tensions with Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia with regards to the Free Territories Trieste, the aftermath of which, many believe, to be the primary reason for his departure."

 ita.1.d:0 "The time has come for the city of Trieste, currently controlled by the UNSC, to be brought back to their respective leader. It is panned to split Trieste in Zone A, the main city and Zone B, the countryside outside of Trieste. Yugoslavia would get the countryside and we would get the city.

 ita.2.d:0 "Yugoslavia is threatening us to keep both parts for themselves. If we don't back down, they will invade Trieste, but this could lead to war between us and Yugoslavia. If we back down, they get both parts and everything stays peacefully."
 ita.2.a:0 "We don't back down!"
 ita.2.b:0 "We stay peacefully."
 ita.202.d:0 "San Marco 1 was launched on December 15, 1964 by an Italian ground crew using an American Scout rocket from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. It is the first Italian satellite and a great achievement for Edoardo Amaldi and his team. Because of their devotion and hard work, Italy became the fifth country to have its own artificial object in Earth's orbit. The main goal of the mission is to conduct ionospheric research. After 272 days of service, San Marco will burn while re-entering Earth's atmosphere."
