 Thai_Focus_1_desc:0 "\nWith the administration of Plaek Phibunsongkhram, a nationalist, it did not take long for the nation to be renamed from Siam. Thailand is a nation of many ethnicities and cultures and the change was originated from the nationalist leader's desire to modernize Thailand and with a campaign of westernization, which encompassed western-style clothing, a new national anthem and flag and a western calendar. It also encompassed the change from the name of Siam to Thailand; as a move that symbolizes the unity of all Tai-speaking people, including the Lao and the Shan but excluding the Chinese; the slogan for the campaign was “Thailand for the Thai”. After Phibunsongkhram was removed from power during the middle of the 1940s, Seni Pramoj renamed it to Siam, as a symbol of the end of the nationalist's regime, but when Plaek came to power in 1949, it was once again renamed to Thailand."
 Thai_Focus_2_desc:0 "Urgent news have arisen, it seems that officers from the Royal Thai Navy had captured the Prime Minister, Plaek Phibunsongkhram and held him hostage during a handover ceremony for the US dredge boat ‘Manhattan' and brought him aboard to the Navy's flagship HTMS ‘Sri Ayudhya'. The ship began to make way downstream towards the Naval Ordnance Department in Bang Na, but the coup plotters had failed to secure the opening of the Memorial Bridge and the flagship was unable to continue its course, a fight quickly ensued and the naval units that sided with the rebels were overwhelmed by police, army and air forces, who were, and are, loyal to the Thai government; the ship was sunk while Phibun was still onboard and had to swim ashore along with sailors. The battle against the plotters has led to the death of 17 military personnel, eight police officers and 103 civilians; more than 500 people were wounded and the coup was declared a failure."
 Thai_Focus_3_desc:0 "After the defeat of the Navy's attempt to coup the government of Phibunsongkhram, the army-led Coup Group, a clique of forty junior army officers who were forced into retirement by Pridi Phanomyong, a Thai Prime Minister, at the end of World War Two, began political maneuvering to establish a larger military cabinet. Its major members are Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, Police General Phao Siyanon and Phin Chunhawan; in the aftermath of the Navy's attempted coup, a political battle ensued between civilian and military leaders for positions in the government and the Coup Group attempted to persuade the King to allow further military voice in elections and more military government officials, which did not prove fruitful – something that the Coup Group later disregarded as they attempted to make their move, being deterred solely by Phibunsongkhram, who was personally pressed by the Coup Group, as the King was returning to Thailand after a trip to Lauseanne, the men could not risk a confrontation with the monarch and therefore, they announced over the radio the dissolution of parliament, the reinstatement of the 1932 constitution and the formation of a provisional government. Phibunsongkhram initially refused but later abided by the Coup, returning as Prime Minister after negotiations."

 Thai_Focus_5_desc:0 "An ultimatum has been handed today to the Government of Plaek Phibunsongkhram, demanding his resignation, being signed by fifty-eight army officers and led by Sarit Thanarat, a Thai general who has been growing in popularity during the last years due to the mismanagements of Phibunsongkhram's government. Soon enough, there was a public gathering to protest against Phibun's government, the crowd has marched to Sarit's residence to show support for the demands of the army; there have been reports that Sarit and his army have already began the coup d'etat, successfully capturing strategic points with no resistance, Phibunsongkhram is nowhere to be found, most likely fleeing the country after what happened, the coup against Phibun and his inefficient government has been successful."
